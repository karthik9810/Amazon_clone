Hey everyone!

I've just uploaded our Amazon Frontend Clone project to GitHub. To ensure that users and potential contributors have all the necessary information about the project, let's create a README file.

The README should include details about the project, such as its purpose, key features, how to get started, how to contribute, and any other relevant information. It's a great way to showcase our project and make it more accessible to others.

Feel free to add any additional sections or information you think would be helpful. Let's collaborate to make our project documentation clear and comprehensive!
